# Tackling Instability in Markowitz Minimum Volatility Portfolios

Since the introduction of Modern Portfolio Theory in 1952, which earned Harry Markowitz
a Nobel Prize in Economics, the asset management industry has changed a lot. By mathematically
proving that portfolio risk can be reduced by simply owning imperfectly correlated
assets, his theory has served as a base approach to portfolio construction from a
systematic perspective. Nevertheless, the solutions to the underlying mathematical optimisation
problem of Markowitz's portfolio construction method present problems with
respect to the concentration, out-of-sample performance and stability with respect to the
input parameters. Here we give a short overview of the asset allocation problem, dene the
mathematical optimisation problem linked to Markowitz's optimal portfolios and analyse
the sources of its instability. Moreover, we present three methods that try to tackle the
instability: two focused on the input covariance matrix and one alternative asset allocation
method. Finally, we compare the performance with respect to concentration, out-of-sample
risk-adjusted returns and stability across time of Markowitz's minimum volatility portfolios
to the portfolios generated by the other three methods during the year 2020, which
contains the market stress period caused by the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak.
